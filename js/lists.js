Well let's board, salvage, and scuttle that wooden ship - in that order - Black Flag style in Metdevil vs An Old, Old Wooden Ship That Was Used During The Civil War Era, er club...<br>Tackle Diversity by taking on four notoriously tough games and Gran Turismo 6, because GT5 isn't achievable, from five different genres.<br><br>I've devised a plan of action against her as follows:<br><br><strong>Strategy</strong> - Command & Conquer Red Alert 3: Strategy will be of utmost importance against Diversity; she's a sly old girl who'll turn on a dime and ride the waves like a demon of the sea!<br><br><strong>Racing</strong> - Gran Turismo 6: Diversity is a quick ship who'll get away from us if we're not quick enough about it. Luckily, she is old, and doesn't handle a headwind as well as us so I don't think we'll need GT5-like speed to catch her in rougher conditions.<br><br><strong>Co-Operative Shooter</strong> - Destiny: You're not alone out there on those rough seas. Look after each other, keep in communication, and watch each others' backs. Only together can we send Diversity to the briny deep!<br><br><strong>Fighting</strong> - Soulcalibur V: Once boarded, Diversity's universal crew will surely prove a worthy challenge. She's scoured the Seven Seas scores over and recruited the toughest crew known to all of the sailing world. The captain's very own daughter wields a magicked sword. Our real challenge here will be meeting face to face with Diversity's own Captain, The Dread Pirate.<br><br><strong>Music</strong> - Rocksmith 2014: Shred and Slash your way through the deckboards of Diversity with your epic axe-wielding skills! Scuttle her and leave her for the merfolk!",

Braid requires memorization and split second reflexes for its Full Speed Run trophy.

Limbo is a dark and treacherous platformer that must be finished with 5 or less deaths with the <strong>No Point in Dying</strong> trophy. The Witness is a lush, colorful puzzler that requires you to run a gauntlet of puzzles while listening to Grieg's 'Anitra's Dance' and 'In the Hall of the Mountain King' for the <strong>Challenge</strong> trophy. Each game is worth playing regardless, but overcoming these trophies make the road to completion for these games that much more rewarding.",

These five games all have a special place in my heart in one way or another. I played Call of Duty 4 on the 360, but spent nearly 2,000 hours there. Did you know I was 25th in the world for the kill count leaderboard for nearly six months? Duke Nukem is the first shooter I ever played. It took me way back to the 90s when we had games that ran off floppy disks. Final Fantasy VII is probably the greatest game of all time, and is home to my favorite character from any game I've played: Aerith Gainsborough. Grand Theft Auto III may not have been the best GTA out there, but it's the one I played the most. I spent hours taking turns with my brother and entering cheat codes to our heart's delight. Rounding out the club is Undertale, a newer game but the nostalgic feel is all the same. The combat, music, and lore make it my favorite game played in 2018. I hope you enjoy completing these games as much as I did.",

    blurb: "These are some of my favourite RPGs to land on PlayStation consoles. These are the reasons why I chose each game:<br><br>Akiba's Trip 2 - As a huge anime and JRPG fan, this game was a must-play for me. The references to several anime series and JRPGs, the typical heroine capture routes, and exploring around Akihabara were all fun aspects to this game.<br><br>Bloodborne - The gameplay, soundtrack, level and boss designs, and atmosphere were all phenomenal in this game. It was the first RPG on PS4 I played that I could sink countless hours into. Obtaining the in this game was a big gaming accomplishment for me as well.<br><br>Dragon's Dogma - Everything about this game was done so well and really pushed the PS3's hardware limits. The massive world to explore, graphics, enemy designs, soundtrack, and gameplay were all fantastic. This is one of my most played games on PS3.<br><br>Final Fantasy XIII - I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan, and this was the first Final Fantasy game to get trophies. Getting the was time-consuming yet satisfying, but I enjoyed every second of it, even the grinds.<br><br>Ni ni Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch - This is my favourite game on PS3, and one of my favourite RPGs of all time. Studio Ghibli, one of the greatest animation studios of all time, took part in developing this game. I'm a huge fan of Studio Ghibli and their movies, and I loved the references in this game to some of those movies. This is a perfect game, and deserves no less than a 10/10.",
